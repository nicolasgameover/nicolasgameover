It is possible to use a swap file on btrfs, but there are some considerations that need taking care of.

btrfs filesystem doesn't let to create snapshots if there is a working swap file on the subvolume. That means that it is highly recommended to place a swap file on a separate subvolume.

Lets assume that the current swap is already off, the / is on /dev/sda1 and Ubuntu is installed with / on @ subvolume and /home is on @home subvolume.

# Mount /dev/sda1 to /mnt.
$ sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt

# If you run ls /mnt, you'll see @, @home and other subvolumes that may be there.
# Create a new @swap subvolume.
$ sudo btrfs sub create /mnt/@swap

# Unmount /dev/sda1 from /mnt
$ sudo umount /mnt

# Create /swap directory where we plan to mount the @swap subvolume.
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/swap

# Mount the @swap subvolume to /swap.
$ sudo mount -o subvol=@swap /dev/sda2 /mnt/swap

# Set the appropriate permissions on the swap subvolume so that only the owner, the root user in this case, has access to the subvolume.
$ sudo chmod 700 /mnt/swap

# Create the swap file.
$ sudo touch /mnt/swap/swapfile

# set 600 permissions to the file.
$ sudo chmod 600 /mnt/swap/swapfile

# Disable COW for this file.
$ sudo chattr +C /mnt/swap/swapfile

# Make sure to disable compression on the swapfile.
$ sudo btrfs property set /mnt/swap/swapfile compression none

# Set size of the swap file to 4G as an example.
$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/swap/swapfile bs=1M count=4096

# Format the swapfile
$ sudo mkswap /mnt/swap/swapfile

# Turn the swap file on.
$ sudo swapon /mnt/swap/swapfile

# Now the new swap should be working.
# You also need to update /etc/fstab to mount all this on boot. Add there two lines:

UUID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX /swap btrfs subvol=@swap 0 0
/swap/swapfile none swap sw 0 0
The UUID is the one of your /dev/sda1.

#Swap file can't be located on a btrfs raid of any sort.
