-vi Editor “Cheat Sheet”

Invoking vi: 			vi filename
Format of vi commands:		[count][command] (count repeats the effect of the command)

-Command mode versus input mode
Vi starts in command mode. The positioning commands
operate only while vi is in command mode. You switch vi
to input mode by entering any one of several vi input commands. (See next section.) Once  in input mode, any character you type is taken to be text and is added to the file. You
cannot execute any commands until you exit input mode.
To exit input mode, press the escape (Esc) key

-Input commands (end with Esc)

a	Append after cursor
i	Insert before cursor
o	Open line below
O	Open line above
:r	file Insert file after current line

-Any of these commands leaves vi in input mode until you
press Esc. Pressing the RETURN key will not take you out
of input mode
